            Hi, I'm Md. Salman Hossan Prottoy

I am a final year undergraduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at American International University-Bangladesh. Passionate learner, currently interested in machine learning, natural language processing, AI and quantum computing. I don't confine myself to a certain branch and accept that anything new is never old to understand.            </div>
